            <h2>Yatzy with PHP API</h2>
            <p>In this section, we have enhanced the Yatzy game by integrating a PHP backend with AJAX to dynamically handle game actions. We created a PHP API that processes dice rolls and score calculations, which are then fetched and displayed using AJAX calls. This allows for a more interactive and dynamic gaming experience.</p>
            
            <h4>Features of PHP API Integration</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dice Roll Handling:</strong> The PHP API manages the dice roll functionality, generating random values for the dice and returning them to the client-side application.</li>
                <li><strong>Score Calculation:</strong> The PHP API calculates scores based on the dice values rolled, ensuring accurate and consistent scoring according to Yatzy rules.</li>
                <li><strong>AJAX Communication:</strong> AJAX is used to send requests to the PHP API and update the game state dynamically without needing to reload the page, providing a seamless user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> The PHP backend maintains game state and player information using sessions, ensuring that the game progress is tracked and managed effectively.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Benefits of Using PHP API and AJAX</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> By offloading processing to the server-side PHP scripts, the client-side application remains responsive and efficient.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong> AJAX allows for real-time updates and interactions, making the game more engaging and user-friendly.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The PHP API can be easily extended to include additional features and functionalities, allowing for future enhancements to the game.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Implementation Details</h4>
            <p>The integration involved setting up a PHP server with endpoints for dice rolls and score calculations. The client-side application uses JavaScript and AJAX to communicate with these endpoints, sending and receiving data as required. This setup ensures that the game logic is processed on the server-side, while the client-side handles user interactions and display updates.</p>

            <h2>Hospital Triage System</h2>
            <p>In this section, we have developed a Hospital Triage System that enhances patient management and wait time tracking in the emergency room. The system uses a combination of PHP backend and AJAX for a seamless experience for both administrators and patients.</p>
            
            <h4>Features of the Hospital Triage System</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Administrator Functions:</strong> Administrators can sign in to access the full list of patients, add new patients, and update patient statuses. The system allows for easy management of patient queues based on severity and wait times.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient Wait Time Tracking:</strong> Patients can sign in using their name and a unique 3-letter code to view their current wait time in the queue. This feature keeps patients informed about their estimated wait times.</li>
                <li><strong>AJAX Communication:</strong> AJAX is utilized to send and receive data between the client-side application and the PHP backend, allowing real-time updates of patient information and wait times without reloading the page.</li>
                <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> The PHP backend handles user sessions to ensure secure access for administrators and accurate tracking of patient information.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Benefits of Using PHP API and AJAX</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Efficient Management:</strong> By using a PHP backend, administrators can efficiently manage patient data and update statuses in real-time, improving overall operational efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Patient Experience:</strong> Patients receive timely updates on their wait times through AJAX-based real-time communication, enhancing their overall experience and reducing uncertainty.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The system is designed to be scalable, with the ability to incorporate additional features and handle increasing amounts of patient data as needed.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Implementation Details</h4>
            <p>The integration involved setting up a PHP server with endpoints for patient management and wait time tracking. The client-side application uses JavaScript and AJAX to interact with these endpoints, providing real-time updates and managing patient data dynamically.</p>
            
            <h4>Database Schema</h4>
            <p>The system utilizes a MySQL database to store and manage data. The database schema includes the following tables:</p>
            
            <h5>Patients Table</h5>
            <pre>
        CREATE TABLE patients (
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            code CHAR(3) NOT NULL,
            severity INT NOT NULL CHECK (severity BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
            status ENUM('waiting', 'treated') DEFAULT 'waiting',
            timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
        );
            </pre>
            <p>This table stores information about patients, including their name, unique 3-letter code, severity of condition, status (waiting or treated), and the timestamp of when the record was created.</p>
        
            <h5>Admins Table</h5>
            <pre>
        CREATE TABLE admins (
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
            password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
        );
            </pre>
            <p>This table contains administrator credentials with a unique username and password for secure access to the administrative functions of the system.</p>
